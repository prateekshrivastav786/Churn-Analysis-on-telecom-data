We will use a telecommunications data for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer data where each row represents one customer. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
